# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository provides an overview of various **data structures** and **algorithms** implemented using the C++ programming language. Below, we explore some common data structures and algorithms, along with their applications.

## Data Structures
---

### 1. Arrays
- A fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
- Efficient for indexed access and static datasets.

### 2. Linked Lists
- A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, connected to the next via a pointer.
- Ideal for dynamic memory allocation and insertion/deletion operations.

### 3. Stack
- A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- Operations:
  - **Push**: Add elements to the top.
  - **Pop**: Remove elements from the top.
- Commonly used for backtracking, expression evaluation, and parsing.

### 4. Queue
- A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- Operations:
  - **Enqueue**: Add elements to the back.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove elements from the front.
- Useful in scheduling and resource management.

### 5. Trees
- A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
- Applications include search trees, heap structures, and representation of hierarchical data.

### 6. Graphs
- A non-linear structure comprising vertices (nodes) and edges.
- Used in network representation, social connections, and pathfinding.

## Algorithms
---

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- Rearrange elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).
- Examples:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**

### 2. Search Algorithms
- Locate a specific element or value in a data structure.
- Examples:
  - **Linear Search**
  - **Binary Search**

### 3. Pathfinding Algorithms
- Identify a path between two points in a graph.
- Examples:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

### 4. Recursion
- A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve sub-problems.
- Commonly used in divide-and-conquer strategies, such as quicksort and merge sort.

## Key Considerations
Choosing the right data structure and algorithm is critical for optimizing performance. Each structure and algorithm comes with its own:
- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**
- Trade-offs in various scenarios.

# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

There are many data structures and algorithms that can be implemented using the C++ programming language. Some common data structures in C++ include:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.  
- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object connected to the next element through a pointer.  
- **Stack**: A data structure that follows the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle and allows elements to be added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top.  
- **Queue**: A data structure that follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and allows elements to be added (enqueued) and removed (dequeued) from the front and back.  
- **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, each node having zero or more child nodes.  
- **Graphs**: A non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges.  

Many algorithms can be implemented using C++, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Algorithms that rearrange a given list of elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending). Examples include bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort.  
- **Search Algorithms**: Search a data structure for a specific element or value. Examples include linear search and binary search.  
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Algorithms that find a path between two points in a graph. Examples include depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).  
- **Recursion**: A programming technique in which a function calls itself with a modified version of its inputs to solve a problem.  

It's important to choose the appropriate data structure and algorithm for a specific task, as different data structures and algorithms have different performance characteristics and trade-offs.
